// Maybe a row along the top of the profile page showing ranks for each game mode?
// Then clicking on one of the rank displays will set that as the
// game mode to use elsewhere.
// Mode selection would then persist at a database level
// That makes it a lot easier to display the correct 'current pool', given that
// page is server side rendered
